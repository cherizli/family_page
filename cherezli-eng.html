Israel-Cherezli family traces its history back to 1807 when the head of the
family – Rabbi Isaac Israel, son of Eliahou, migrated to Jerusalem from Sherez
(also known as Serres, Serrai and Shiron), a town located some 50 miles
north-east of Thesaloniki (Salonica) <a
href="http://www.cherezli.com/images/greece2.gif">(see map)</a>. Sherez is
presently located in Greece but, at the time, was located in Turkey and
geographically forms part <span class=GramE>of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Macedonia</span>. With the arrival of the Jewish exiles from Spain and
Portugal at the beginning of the 16<sup>th</sup> century, it became a home for
some 600 families. The Jewish community flourished and grew. It was home to
rabbinical scholars and prominent Sephardic families, including the Gatenio,
Castro, Calderon, Atias and other notable families. In the 17<sup>th</sup>
century the community was shaken by the Sabbatean movement <a
href="http://www.greecetravel.com/jewishhistory/ancient.html">(a short history
of the Jews in Greece)</a>. The Jewish community remained in Sherez until World
War II when most of its members were deported by the Nazis and perished in the
Holocaust. Today, there are virtually no Jewish families in <a

Isaac Israel was born in Sherez around 1775 and arrived in Jerusalem in 1807
with two young children: Eliahou (born 1800) and Hayim-Moshe (born 1803). In
Jerusalem, he was nicknamed Israel “Sherezli” (i.e. Israel from Sherez),
probably in order to distinguish him from other families with the surname
Israel (including members of the Israel family of Rhodes living in Jerusalem).
The name was later transliterated (under French influence) as “Cherezli”.
Records do not reveal the name of his wife or whether she accompanied him to
Jerusalem. However, they disclose that he arrived with two young sons – Eliahou
and Hayim-Moshe.</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The
historian M. D. Gaon in his book “<b><i>Yehudei Ha-Mizrah Be-Eretz Israel</i></b>”
(1938) states that Isaac Israel-Cherezli’s father was named Eliahou Israel. We
have seen no other documentary evidence to support this assertion and are
uncertain whether Gaon did have such evidence or whether it was an educated
guess. It is and was a common tradition among Sephardic Jews to name a
first-born son after his paternal grandfather. Determining Isaac’s father is
critical for dispelling the widespread myth that the Isaac was the son of Rabbi
Moshe Israel (Jerusalem, 1670 – Alexandria, 1740), Chief Rabbi of Rhodes and
later Alexandria and <span class=GramE>the</span> author of 3 volumes of
responsa entitled “<b><i>Mas’at Moshe</i></b>”. In fact, this Moshe Israel
could not have been the father of Isaac Israel-Cherezli because he died in
1740, some 35 years before Isaac was born. The historians A.L. Frumkin and E.
Rivlin in “<b><i>Toldot Hakhamei Yerushalayim</i></b>” (Jerusalem, 1929) and,
more recently Giroa Posielov in “<b><i>Hakhamei Yehudei Mitzrayim</i></b>”
(Jerusalem, 1998) write that Isaac Israel-Cherezli descends from a different
Israel family to that of Rabbi Moshe Israel, the patriarch of the Israel family
of Rhodes</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-language:

<p class=MsoBodyText>A family tree was prepared in the 1970s by Michel Maurice
Israel (Cairo, 1902-Paris, 1979), in conjunction with his first cousin Michel
Eid Israel, great grandsons of Rabbi Yomtov Israel-Cherezli (Jerusalem,
1821-1891), Chief Rabbi Cairo and Egypt between 1866 and 1891. That family
tree, which is written in French, shows Rabbi Isaac Israel-Cherezli to be a son
of Rabbi Moshe Israel. In our view, this is erroneous and has contributed to a
degree of confusion in the family as to its origin. Although Rabbi Moshe Israel
did have a son called Isaac, he lived in Crete and not in Sherez. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>There
are several reasons why is it highly unlikely that Rabbi Moshe Israel was the
father of Rabbi Isaac Israel-Cherezli. Firstly, it appears that Isaac’s father
was called Eliahou and not Moshe. Secondly, Moshe died in 1740 and Isaac was born
around 1775, some 35 years later. Thirdly, Moshe’s other <span class=GramE>sons,</span>
Hayim-Abraham and Eliahou were born in 1708 and 1710, some 65 years before
Isaac was born. Fourthly, there is no record of Moshe’s son, Isaac, ever having
lived in Sherez. Fifthly, Rabbi Yomtov Israel-Cherezli, in his book on the
customs of the Jews of Cairo “<b><i>Minhagei Mitzrayim</i></b>” (Jerusalem,
1873), refers to the writings of Rabbi Moshe Israel and his rabbinic
descendants but makes no reference to any relationship with them. And lastly,
there is no independent documentary or historical evidence of any relationship
between the Israel-Cherezli family and the Israel family of Rhodes descended
from Rabbi Moshe Israel.</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Eliahou
Israel-Cherezli (1800-1866) and Hayim-Moshe Israel-Cherezli (1803-1863), sons
of Isaac Israel-Cherezli, arrived in Jerusalem as young children and studied
there. Hayim-Moshe remained in Jerusalem and his descendants established a
large family in Eretz Israel. His brother, Eliahou, was invited to serve as the
Chief Rabbi of Cairo in 1846 where he died 20 years later. His descendants
remained in Egypt until the dispersion of the Egyptian Jewish community after
1948, after which they settled all over the world including Israel, France,
Italy, Switzerland, Australia and the USA.</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Therefore,
the Israel-Cherezli family is divided into two main branches; the Israeli
branch, descended from Rabbi Hayim-Moshe Israel-Cherezli, and the Egyptian
branch, descended from Rabbi Eliahou Israel-Cherezli. The Israeli branch of the
family gradually dropped the original surname Israel and retained the nickname
Cherezli (in various spellings) as their surname. That branch consists of eight
generations, mainly in Israel. The members of the family spell and pronounce
the name in various forms such as Cherezli, Cherizli, Shirizli and Sherizly.
Some have changed their surname to a more modern, “Israeli” form, including:
Argaman, Shiraz, Shemer, Israeli, and Sar’el. The proliferation of surnames has
made this research and the future maintenance of the family tree quite
difficult. The Egyptian branch of the family gradually dropped the nickname
Cherezli and retained the original surname Israel, although after the
dispersion of the family from Egypt in the aftermath of the creation of the
State of Israel and the overthrow of the Monarchy, individual members of the
family changed their surname to Elisar and Ceresi.</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Hayim-Moshe
Israel-Cherezli was born in Sherez about 1803 and arrived in Jerusalem when he
was four years old. He became prominent in the Jewish community and held
several important positions. He was a member of the Council of the Sephardic
community of Jerusalem and of the “Majlis Idara” – the advisory council to the
Ottoman rulers. From 1848 until his death in 1863 he served as a representative
of the Jewish community and a translator in the Ottoman Court. In addition he
served as a judge – “Dayan Sheni” - on the Bet Din, the Rabbinical Court of the
Sephardic community in Jerusalem. According to family tradition, his father -
Isaac - is counted as the first generation in Eretz Israel and Hayim- Moshe is
the second generation. In a census taken in Jerusalem in 1839 on behalf of Sir
Moses <a href="http://www.sephardicstudies.org/montefiore.html">Montefiore</a>,
for the purpose of charitable donations, there is an entry for Hayim-Moshe
Israel-Cherezli (although he is merely listed as “Hayim son of Yitshak” at page
24). The <a href="http://www.sephardicstudies.org/census_jerusalem.pdf">census</a>
indicates that he came from “Shiron” (i.e., Serres) in 1809 [sic], was aged 35
(in 1839), studied Torah, and was married. In a later census held in 1855,
there is more information about him. It states that he was 52 years old at the
time and had immigrated from “Shiron” (i.e., Serres). He was married to two wives
at the same time, as was permitted to Sephardi men who were not bound by the
Ordinance of Rabbenu Gershom proscribing polygamy for Ashkenazi (but not
Sephardi) men. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Isaac Israel-Cherezli, son of Hayim-Moshe, followed in his father’s footsteps
and held several positions in the Sephardic community, including its Bet Din
(Rabbinical Court) and the “Majlis Idara”. There are several references to his
important communal activities in the book “<b><i>Jews in the Moslem Religious
Court</i></b>” (Jerusalem, 2003) where he appears in most of the cases relating
to the Jewish community before the Ottoman court. His position as the Clerk of
the Sephardic community was not without challenge. The newspaper of the time, “<b><i>Ha-Levanon</i></b>”
reports (1869) that once he was asked to collect funds owing to the community
from a “Shaliach” who <span class=GramE>refused<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>to</span> deliver up the donations he had collected abroad. In another
incident, Isaac was robbed in his home, and badly wounded, by three Arab
gangsters, who thought he kept the community’s funds in his home. Another
unusual story is his effort to prevent one of the elders from purchasing the
“Kotel Ha’Maaravi” which Isaac thought should be bought by the congregation as
a whole and not by a single person. The price was set and the seller was
willing, but the conflict ended with none of the two parties buying the land. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>this</span> branch of the family, who left his mark on the Jewish

Shelomo Israel-Cherezli, also known by his Hebrew initials <i>shin-yud-shin</i>
as “Shayish” (meaning “marble” in Hebrew), is most known for his work in
reviving the Hebrew language in Israel. He started by opening a library in his
home for French and Hebrew books which were rare at the time. He went on to
translate many books from French to Hebrew and Ladino – the main language
spoken among Sephardic Jews in those days. By some accounts, Shelomo published
52 books in Hebrew and 63 in Ladino, as well as many other publications.
Shelomo started his publishing life as an employee in the printing press of the
famous Eliezer Ben-Yehuda. In 1900 he and his friend Ben-Zion Tarragan
purchased the press from Ben-Yehuda and he invested his time, effort and
capital in improving it. Shelomo then took a bold step and published the first
commercial weekly magazine called “<b><i>Ha-Pardes</i></b>” in three languages:
Hebrew, Yiddish and Ladino. World War I brought disaster upon Shelomo’s work -
the Turks confiscated his press and drafted him into the Army. When the War
ended, he returned to Jerusalem and opened a bookstore – remaining true to his
passion. This store was also the unofficial office for “Ha-Marpeh” – the first
healthcare organisation for the poor in Israel. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Israel- Cherezli was married twice. By his first wife, Rachel Shabbetay, he had
three children. Rachel passed away at a young age (circa 1910) and Shelomo
remarried Hanna Muriciano (1890-1994) who bore him 13 more children. Shelomo
gave all his male children names commencing with the prefix “Achi” (meaning “My
Brother” in Hebrew) to emphasise their family bond.<span

second branch consists of the descendants of Rabbi Eliahou Israel-Cherezli
(1800-1866), the eldest son of Rabbi Isaac Israel-Cherezli. Eliahou studied in
the yeshivot of Jerusalem. In the 1830s he travelled to Morocco as a shaliach
for the Sephardic community of Jerusalem. In 1846, he was appointed Chief Rabbi
of Cairo and Egypt (excluding Alexandria) and held this position until his death
on Sunday, 10 Av 1866 (on which day Tisha'a Be-Av was commemorated that year).
He was decorated by the Sultan in Istanbul. He befriended the Jerusalem
shaliach and noted Jewish traveller, Rabbi Jacob Levy Sapir, who visited Egypt
on three occasions. Rabbi Eliahou Israel-Cherezli is referred to in Sapir's
travelogue &quot;<b><i>Even Sapir</i></b>&quot;, which also contains a
responsum by him on the permissibility of Jewish residence in Egypt after the
Exodus. Like his brother Rabbi Hayim-Moshe, Rabbi Eliahou Israel-Cherezli also
had two wives. His first wife, Esther, was the daughter of Rabbi Yomtov Levy of
Jerusalem. She died in Jerusalem in 1887.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

Yomtov Israel-Cherezli was born in Jerusalem in 1821 and died there on 13 Ab

Esther Levy. <span class=GramE>He<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

Chief Rabbi. He too is referred to by Sapir, in his travelogue &quot;<b><i>Even
Sapir</i></b>&quot;, who met him on his travels through Egypt in the 1850/60s.
Rabbi Yomtov Israel-Cherezli was appointed Chief Rabbi of Cairo in the second
half of 1866, after Rosh Ha-Shanah, a few months after the death of his father.
Even prior to his appointment, he was active in the leadership and
representation of the Jewish Community of Cairo. He was a member of the Maglis
Shawra el Dawla (Council of State) of the Wezaret el-Dakhlieh (Ministry of the
Interior). Like his father, Rabbi Yomtov Israel-Cherezli too was decorated by
the Sultan in Istanbul. He was the author of <b><i>Minhagei Mitsrayim</i></b>
(Jerusalem, 1873) on the religious customs of the Jews of Egypt. He also
published Rabbi Hayim Moda'i's manuscript <b><i>Tiv Gittin</i></b>, with his
own annotations, in Jerusalem in 1875. The manuscript had been inherited by
Rabbi Moda'i's son-in-law, Rabbi Moshe Yossef Algazi, Chief Rabbi of Cairo
until 1846. Upon Rabbi Algazi's death, it passed to his successor, Rabbi
Eliahou Israel-Cherezli and then to his son, Rabbi Yomtov Israel-Cherezli.
Rabbi Yomtov’s wife, Miriam, was the daughter of Rabbi Moshe Zacuta of
Jerusalem who was a great-grandson of Rabbi Hayim Modai (Safed, 1710-1794).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

1884, Rabbi Yomtov Israel-Cherezli returned to live and die in Jerusalem, the
city of his birth. His house in the Mahaneh Yehuda suburb of Jerusalem exists
to this day. However, he remained the titular Chief Rabbi of Cairo and Rabbi
Mercado Tarragan attended to daily matters in his absence. Upon Rabbi
Tarragan's retirement to Jerusalem in 1890, Rabbi Yomtov Israel-Cherezli
returned to Cairo until the appointment of his successor, Rabbi Rafael Aharon
Ben-Shimeon in the month of Nissan, 1891. Rabbi Yomtov Israel-Cherezli died in
Jerusalem on 13 Ab 1891 and was buried on the Mount of Olives. In 1941, on the
40th anniversary of his death, his biography <b><i>Halikhot Yomtob </i></b>was
published in Cairo by Yomtob Levy-Tantaui, the son of his personal secretary,
under the auspices of the Midrash Ribbi Shimeon Bar-Yohay. He had three sons
